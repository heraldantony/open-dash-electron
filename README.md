# open-dash-electron

indash multimedia system

This is a fork of https://github.com/physiii/open-dash, that is modified to run using electron instead of nw.js.

Electron (https://electronjs.org/) runs on "arm" based systems (Raspberry Pi) by default. For nw.js you need to use a community ported binary (https://github.com/LeonardLaszlo/nw.js-armv7-binaries) on "arm" systems.

## To run the unit tests
npm install -g jasmine

npm install jasmine

### in the project folder
npm install 

npm run test
